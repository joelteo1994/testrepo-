First Repo created as part of IBM Professional Data Science Certificate Course 

## Readme quick notes 
A README is often the first item a visitor will see when visiting your repository. README files typically include information on **5 key elements**:

1. What the project does
2. Why the project is useful
3. How users can get started with the project
4. Where users can get help with your project
5.  Who maintains and contributes to the project

Other notes: 
* If you put your README file in your repository's hidden .github, root, or docs directory, GitHub will recognize and automatically surface your README to repository visitors.
* If a repository contains more than one README file, then the file shown is chosen from locations in the following order: the .github directory, then the repository's root directory, and finally the docs directory.
* If you add a README file to the root of a public repository with the same name as your username, that README will automatically appear on your profile page. You can edit your profile README with GitHub Flavored Markdown to create a personalized section on your profile. For more information, see "Managing your profile README."
